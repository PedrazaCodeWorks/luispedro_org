Having become recently interested in stoicism, I picked up the classic.

The book is disappointing. At times wonderfully insightful, too often just
boring and predictable.

Good, if short, introduction on Seneca's life and writing. It even contains
several much more incisive critiques of the style than I could attempt:

    Seneca writes as a boare does pisse, scilicet by jirkes.

(This wonderful quote is hidden in the notes at the end of the book).

As many old books do, this one sports a note on the back noting *how far
advanced of its time his ideas were*, by which it is meant *how close to our
current ideas the ideas in this old book are*. Curiously, this same fact is
rarely noted in the opposite direction: how old our current ideas are, which I
tend to find a much more interesting conclusion.
