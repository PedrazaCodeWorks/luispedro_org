I am a computational biologist. For my graduate work, at `Carnegie Mellon
University <http://www.compbio.cmu.edu/>`_, I worked on computer vision for
subcellular location analysis.

My postdoctoral work at the `Mhlanga Lab
<http://mhlangalab.synbio.csir.co.za/>`__ focuses on the nuclear organisation
of the malaria parasite (Plasmodium). More `details on the project
</projects/plasmodium>`__.
