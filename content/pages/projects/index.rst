Nuclear Segmentation
--------------------

The goal of this project was to quantitatively evaluate a series of nuclear
segmentation algorithms for use in our work. We hand-segmented several images
from two datasets and used those as gold standards to evaluate methods.

SLIF
----

SLIF is the `structured literature image finder` (previously, `subcellular
location image finder`).

It searches through scientific journals, looking for images, which it
categorises, makes available, and (in some cases, at least) analyses.

Programming for Scientists
--------------------------

Programming for Scientists is a course I designed for scientists who write
code. The project grew out of informal discussions with others, but it
crystalised around the observation that many scientists now write code as one
of their primary activities (at least as defined on time spent) without a
proper formal background for it.
