SLIF
----

SLIF is the `structured literature image finder` (previously, `subcellular
location image finder`).

It searches through scientific journals, looking for images, which it
categorises, makes available, and (in some cases, at least) analyses.

Programming for Scientists
--------------------------

Programming for Scientists is a course I designed for scientists who write
code. The project grew out of informal discussions with others, but it
crystalised around the observation that many scientists now write code as one
of their primary activities (at least as defined on time spent) without a
proper formal background for it.
