FAQ
---

**Do I need to bring computer?**

The course will take place in the computer labs and I have asked that the
necessary software be installed there. However, you will be asked to install it
on your own computer and, if you want to bring a laptop to class, that is a
good idea too.

I will discuss this in the first session, but if you want to go ahead, please
install the following (for Windows):

http://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/

For Mac OS, please install EPD:

(It is free of cost for academics).

For Linux, just use your own distributions' package manager. You will need the
following packages:

- python
- python-numpy
- python-matplotlib

**Why are you teaching Python?**

Python is a modern language which is increasingly used for scientific
programming. It is open-source and has a thriving open-source community of
scientific software.
