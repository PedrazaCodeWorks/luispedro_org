Nuclear Mapping in Plasmodium
=============================

Plasmodium, the malaria causing parasite, like all eukariots, regulates the
expression of its genes by many forms, including chromatin organization. In
this species, the spatial organization of chromatin seems to be regulated in
clinically-relevant ways.

This project pursues these observations to build models of chromatin in
blood-stage Plasmodium falciparum. The goal is to relate observations of
chromatin state and organization to gene expression. In particular, I am
imaging different chromatin marks using fluorescence microscopy in different
time points.
