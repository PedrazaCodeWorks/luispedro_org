SLIF
====

SLIF is the `structured literature image finder` (previously, `subcellular
location image finder`).

It searches through scientific journals, looking for images, which it
categorises, makes available, and (in some cases, at least) analyses.

The first paper focus most on the image analysis side of the pipeline, the
second of the overall service.
