(2010) Unsupervised Subcellular Pattern Unmixing
------------------------------------------------

The goal of this project was to extend the supervised unmixing methods to an
unsupervised setting. The results were surprisingly good: *unsupervised is as
good as supervised.*

(2009) Nuclear Segmentation
---------------------------

This was an off-shoot of my work on RandTag. The goal was to figure out the
best segmentation algorithm for our data in an unbiased, quantitative, way. We
built a data set of hand-segmented images and tried out a few algorithms.

(2009-2010) SLIF: Structured Literature Image Finder
----------------------------------------------------

The `SLIF Project </projects/slif>`_ 

On this project, I worked mainly on the image handling half of the pipeline,
but also on integration of the whole system. The work I did on the image
pipeline included using active learning techniques for dataset generation, and
development of multi-class image classifiers.

Slif is available at `http://slif.cbi.cmu.edu <http://slif.cbi.cmu.edu>`_.
