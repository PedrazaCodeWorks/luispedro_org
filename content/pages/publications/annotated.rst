(2009-2010) SLIF: Structured Literature Image Finder
----------------------------------------------------

The `SLIF Project </projects/slif>`_ 

On this project, I worked mainly on the image handling half of the pipeline,
but also on integration of the whole system. The work I did on the image
pipeline included using active learning techniques for dataset generation, and
development of multi-class image classifiers.

Slif is available at `http://slif.cbi.cmu.edu <http://slif.cbi.cmu.edu>`_.
