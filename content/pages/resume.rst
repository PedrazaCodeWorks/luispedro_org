Research Highlights
-------------------

Proteome-wide Study of Subcellular Location in Mouse Fibroblasts
................................................................

I developed new methods for learning from both a very large collection of
images of fluorescently tagged proteins and other forms of data (sequence
information, database information). This work builds on my past work. A
manuscript describing it is in preparation.

Unsupervised Subcellular Pattern Unmixing
.........................................

Many proteins are located in more than one organelle simultaneously, a
phenomenon known as a mixed pattern (the pattern corresponding to a single
organelle being a pure pattern). Recovering the organelle structure from image
data where mixed patterns are present is known as the unsupervised unmixing
problem in subcellular location. We developed new models for
solving this problem. Our solution was chosen as one of the `highlights of 2010
in computational biology by the journal Nature Biotechnology
<http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nbt.1747>`__

Structured Literature Image Finder (SLIF)
.........................................

SLIF is a search engine that indexes biomedical papers with their images. In
this project, I was responsible for the computer vision aspects of the
processing pipeline. I also handled much of the integration effort of the
several components and coordinated the preparation of the multi-author
publications that resulted from the effort. This project was a finalist in the
`Elsevier Grand Challenge <http://www.elseviergrandchallenge.com/>`__ (4 teams
out of 70 were chosen for the final). I represented our team in both the
semi-final and the final of this competition.

Work Experience
----------------

Teaching
........

**Designed and taught** a course in computer programming for the sciences
(`Programming for Scientists </pfs>`__). This was a semester-long course taught
at Carnegie Mellon University in Spring 2009 (as a student-taught course). In
2012, I taught a shortened version of this at IMM as a two-and-a-half day
workshop.

*Teaching Assistant* for Decision Support Systems at Technical University of
Lisbon (Spring 2005). Co-designed and co-taught a Computer Initiation Course for
Adults in a social housing project (pro-bono). *Teaching Assistant* for
Laboratory Methods for Computational Biology at Carnegie Mellon University
(Spring 2008).

Webdesign
.........

Designed the website for ICSV12 (Twelfth International Congress on Sound and
Vibration) and administered the website for the Portuguese non-profit Medicos
Pela Escolha (pro bono).

Local Committee for Portuguese-American Postgraduate Society National Forum
...........................................................................
I headed the local organising committee for the 2010 edition of this annual
event. It took place in Pittsburgh and included, as speakers, cabinet-level
Portuguese government officials, renowned researchers, artists, as well as
participants from all around the US.

Producer for IST Theatre Group
..............................
I served as the producer for the IST Theatre Group, which is one of the top
university theatre groups in Portugal. We participated in several festivals,
including international festivals. As producer, my activities included
fund-raising and management.

Open Source Programming
.......................
I was a member of the `kde project <http://www.kde.org>`__ from 2000 through
2006. I was maintainer of the application kghostview.

I publish and maintainx many open source projects of interest to his research,
such as image processing or machine learning code. See the full list in my
`github page <http://www.github.com/luispedro>`_.
