What is Computational Biology?
------------------------------

It is the field of studying biology by using computers. It involves, for
example, computer simulation of biological systems, involved computer
processing of biological data (images, sequences, ...), and other problems
motivated by biology.

It is **not** computation inspired by biological models or computation by means
of biological systems (DNA-based computation). Those are both separate fields.
