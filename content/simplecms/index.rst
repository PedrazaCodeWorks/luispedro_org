I am a computational biologist. For my graduate work, at `Carnegie Mellon
University <http://www.compbio.cmu.edu/>`_, I worked on computer vision for
subcellular location analysis.

My postdoctoral work at the `Mhlanga Lab
<http://mhlangalab.synbio.csir.co.za/>`__ focuses on the nuclear organisation
of the malaria parasite (Plasmodium). More `details on the project

Upcoming Travels & Talks
========================

.. I have no current travel plans (`invite me <mailto:luis@luispedro.org>`__).


**June 12 2012** I will give a talk at the Lisbon Machine Learning Lunch
(Instituto Superior Tecnico, room PA2, at 13.00).

**July 2012** I will be teaching an introductory Python tutorial at this
year's edition of the `Lisbon Machine Learning School <http://lxmls.it.pt/Home.html>`__.
This is agreat event to learn machine learning and it's a great time of year to
visit Lisbon.

**July 2012** I will be visiting Luxembourg.

`Email me <mailto:luis@luispedro.org>`__ if you want to set up meetings at any
of these opportunities.
