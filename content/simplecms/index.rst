I am a computational biologist. For my graduate work, at `Carnegie Mellon
University <http://www.compbio.cmu.edu/>`_, I worked on computer vision for
subcellular location analysis.

My postdoctoral work at the `Mhlanga Lab
<http://mhlangalab.synbio.csir.co.za/>`__ will focus on the malaria parasite
(Plasmodium).
