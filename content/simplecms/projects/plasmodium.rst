Nuclear Mapping in Plasmodium
=============================

Plasmodium, the malaria causing parasite, like all eukariots, regulates the
expression of its genes by many forms, including chromatin organization. In
this species, the spatial organization of chromatin seems to be regulated in
clinically-relevant ways.

This project pursues these observations to build models of chromatin in
blood-stage Plasmodium falciparum. The goal is to relate observations of
chromatin state and organization to gene expression.

Technically, this project uses a mixture of imaging and next-generation
sequencing (using protocols such as ChIP-seq or ChIA-PET, as well as RNA-seq).
Computational integration of these datasources is the major computational
challenge.
