Hex: Reimplementing TeX in Haskell
==================================

Hex is a reimplementation of TeX in Haskell. It is not very functional yet. It
just does macro expansion. The main goals are for me to learn TeX and Haskell
by implementing on in the other.

Ideally, I will have a version of TeX that is more flexible and extensible than
the current one (which I use because I love its output, but cannot bear its
error messages).
