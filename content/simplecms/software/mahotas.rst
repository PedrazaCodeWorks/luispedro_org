Mahotas: Image Processing in Python
===================================

Mahotas is a set of functions for image processing in Python.

It is completely based on numpy arrays as its datatype. It has its heavy
routines implemented in clean C++ in a way that is both very clean, type
independent (using templates), and fast.

All of the code is self contained and it has no other dependencies than numpy.

Algorithms
----------

- watershed
- thresholding
- convex hull computation
- polygon drawing
- ...

You can get the code from `github <http://www.github.com/luispedro/mahotas>`_.
