Milksets: Machine Learning Datasets in Python
=============================================

This is a companion package to `milk </software/milk>`_ which consists of
datasets from UCI in a Pythonic format.

It is used as::

    from milksets import wine
    features,labels = wine.load()

`features` will be a 2d-`numpy.ndarray` of features and `labels` will be a
1d-`numpy.ndarray` of labels starting at `0` through `N-1` (independently of
how the labels were coded in the original data).

Where can I get it?
