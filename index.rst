I am a computational biologist. I work at the European Molecular Biology
Laboratory (EMBL) in `Peer Bork's group <http://www.embl.de/~bork/>`__ in
microbial community analysis using metagenomics. I have a PhD from `Carnegie
Mellon University <http://www.compbio.cmu.edu/>`_ (2011), where I worked on
`bioimage informatics <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioimage_informatics>`__
for subcellular location analysis with `Bob Murphy
<http://murphylab.web.cmu.edu/>`__.

I blog about science at `metarabbit.wordpress.com
<http://metarabbit.wordpress.com>`__ and tweet (mostly about sciency things) as
`@luispedrocoelho <https://twitter.com/luispedrocoelho>`__. I co-wrote
`Building Machine Learning Systems with Python
<http://www.packtpub.com/building-machine-learning-systems-with-python/book>`__.

My `Erdös-Bacon number is 7 </erdos-bacon>`__.

Research Interests
==================

**Technical version:** I am interested in combining meta'omics (methods that
obtain high-throughput information on microbial communities such as
metagenomics and metatranscriptomics) analysis with machine learning approaches
to learn about microbial communities in different environments.

My work is a mix of of `method development
<http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v10/n12/abs/nmeth.2693.html>`__ and
`applications <http://doi.org/10.1126/science.1261359>`__.  In methodological
terms, I worry a lot about `correct evaluation of methods
<http://luispedro.org/projects/gen-classification>`__ and avoiding
over-inflated measures of performance. I also work in scaling up methods to
work on large-scale problems.

**Not-so technical version:** With modern technology, namely robotic
instruments, it is easy to acquire a lot of microscopic pictures. It is also
possible to acquire large sequence datasets with the DNA of many organisms. I
use these two families of technologies to investigate what is happening in
mixed microbial communities such as the one in our guts, the `microbiome
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiome>`__.

In order to be able to use these data, I also need to develop new computer
methods (software) for these tasks. Thus my work is a mix of solving biological
problems and tackling the software issues that stand in the way of doing so.
