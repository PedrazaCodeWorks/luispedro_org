	abstract = {The problem we address is text indexing for approximate matching. Given a text $T$ which undergoes some preprocessing to generate an index, we can later query this index to identify the places where a string occurs up to a certain number of errors $k$ (edition distance). The indexing structure occupies space $O(n \log^k n)$ in the average case, independent of alphabet size. This structure can be used to report the existence of a match with k errors in $O(3^k m^{k+1})$ and to report the occurrences in $O(3^k m^{k+1} + ed)$ time, where $m$ is the length of the pattern and ed and the number of matching edit scripts. The construction of the structure has time bound by $O(kNS)$, where $N$ is the number of nodes in the index and $S$ the alphabet size.},

	abstract={We propose an adaptive multiresolution (MR) approach to the classification of fingerprint images. The system adds MR decomposition in front of a generic classifier consisting of feature computation and classification in each MR subspace, yielding local decisions, which are then combined into a global decision using a weighting algorithm. In our previous work on classification of protein subcellular location images, we showed that the space-frequency localized information in the MR subspaces adds significantly to the discriminative power of the system. Here, we go one step farther; We develop a new weighting method which allows for the discriminative power of each subband to be expressed and examined within each class. This, in turn, allows us to evaluate the importance of the information contained within a specific subband. Moreover, we develop a pruning procedure to eliminate the subbands that do not contain useful information. This leads to potential identification of the appropriate MR decomposition both on a per class basis and for a given dataset. With this new approach, we make the system adaptive, flexible as well as more accurate and efficient.},

	abstract = {Our group has previously used machine learning techniques to develop computational systems to automatically analyse fluorescence microscope images and classify the location of the depicted protein. Based on this work, we developed a system, the Subcellular Location Image Finder (slif), which mines images from scientifioc journals for analysis.

For some of the images in journals, the system is able to automatically compute the pixel resolution (the physical space represented by each pixel), by identifying a scale bar and processing the caption text. However, scale bars are not always included. For those images, the pixel resolution is unknown. Blindly feeding these images into the classification pipeline results in unacceptably low accuracy. We first describe methods that minimise the impact of this problem by training resolution-insensitive classifiers.

We show that these techniques are of limited use as classifiers can only be made insensitive to resolutions which are similar to each other. We then approach the problem in a different way by trying to estimate the resolution automatically and processing the image based on this prediction. Testing on digitally down-sampled images shows that the combination of these two approaches gives classification results which are essentially as good as if the resolution had been known.

    abstract = {With the advent of high-throughput microscopes, researchers can routinely image hundreds of different proteins per day, generating thousands of images. To be able to organize these images and extract meaningful information, we need automatic methods. The state-of-the-art in automated subcellular localization is classification in the space of image features. This approach is not suited, however, for handling mixture patterns (the pattern of a protein present in more than one location).

We have previously described methods for determining the fraction of fluorescence in various subcellular locations when the basic locations in which a protein can be present are given a priori. However, knowing all fundamental patterns a priori may be problematic. The alternative is unsupervised unmixing: given a set of images from different proteins, identify the basic patterns that best explain all the observed images as either examples of such basic patterns or combinations thereof. 

We extend our previous work to handle this problem. Using a validation dataset, we show that this method can recover the underlying mixed patterns. It identifies meaningful basis patterns and mixture coefficients that correlate well with the probe concentrations that generated the dataset (the probe concentrations were kept hidden from the algorithm).},
