Git Content Management System
=============================

How is this website run?
------------------------

This is a django website with a twist: *all content is stored in text files*. I manage those files with git. A little script loads those files into the database and then django serves them.

In fact, all of the content and its history is actually `publicly available`_ (but you don't have to make your history available in order to use this system).

.. _`publicly available`: http://github.com/luispedro/website.content

Where can I get the code for this?
----------------------------------

Github_, of course. The code is license Affero 3 (GPL for web applications).

Why is this better than `gitwiki`_?
-----------------------------------

.. _`gitwiki`: http://github.com/al3x/git-wiki

Because you can store any type of data, not only hyper-text files. Also, you can add as much structure as you'd like.

Why is this worse than gitwiki?
--------------------------------

Because there is *no web front-end* to the history or even an edit button. It's git all the way.

For example, in this website, the `conferences </conferences/upcoming/>`_ is a django app whose data is a text file that looks like:

::

    name: International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)
    short_name: ISBI
    location: Rotterdam, The Netherlands
    start: April 14 2010
    end: April 17 2010
    submission_deadline: November 2 2009

Actually, the menus on this website are also saved as a `yaml <http://www.yaml.org>`_ file.

This is not really comparable to wiki-git-like projects. We just have different goals.
