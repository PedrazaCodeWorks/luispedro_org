Git Content Management System
=============================

How is this website run?
------------------------

This is a django website with a twist: *all content is stored in text files*. I manage those files with git. A little script loads those files into the database and then django serves them.

In fact, all of the content and its history is actually `publicly available`_ (but you don't have to make your history available in order to use this system).

.. _`publicly available`: http://github.com/luispedro/website.content

Where can I get the code for this?
----------------------------------

Github_, of course. The code is license Affero 3 (GPL for web applications).

Why is this better than gitwiki?
--------------------------------

Because you can store any type of data, not only hyper-text files. Also, you can add as much structure as you'd like.
