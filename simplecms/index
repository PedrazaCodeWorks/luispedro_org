Teaching
========
In Spring 2009, I am teaching a course called Programming for Scientists which is intended as an intermediate class for working scientists who program with only an introductory course or just having informally picked up a language.

Other Interests
================
I keep a blog, the Mutual Information, where I discuss things from cooking vegetarian to the relationships between anarco-capitalistic atomic communities and multiculturalism.

When given the opportunity, I will run away for a jog in the park.

I have also worked on some open-source software.
