Who am I?

I am a Computational Biology PhD. candidate in the `Joint Carnegie Mellon-U. of
Pittsburgh Ph.D. Program <http://www.compbio.cmu.edu/>`_ in Pittsburgh.

I work at the `Murphy Lab <http://murphylab.web.cmu.edu/>`_ with fluorescent
microscopy images. My mission is to find a completely novel way to interpret
these by pushing the field in computer vision and machine learning. In general,
my research aims to be practical and applied while keeping itself theoretically
well-grounded.

Teaching
========

In Spring 2009, I taught a course called `Programming for Scientists </pfs>`_
which I intended as an intermediate class for working scientists who program
with only an introductory course or just having informally picked up a language.

I *will not be teaching this in Spring 2010*, but I certainly hope to have an
opportunity to teach it again.

Other Interests
================
I keep a blog, the `Mutual Information <http://www.mutualinformation.org>`_,
where I discuss things from cooking vegetarian to the relationships between
anarco-capitalistic atomic communities and multiculturalism.

When given the opportunity, I will run away for a jog in the park.

I have also worked on some open-source software.
