I am a Computational Biology student in the `Joint Carnegie Mellon-U. of Pittsburgh Ph.D. Program <http://www.compbio.cmu.edu/>`_ in Pittsburgh.

I work at the `Murphy Lab <http://murphylab.web.cmu.edu/>`_ in problems related to interpreting fluorescent microscopy images.

Teaching
========
In Spring 2009, I taught a course called `Programming for Scientists </pfs>`_ which is intended as an intermediate class for working scientists who program with only an introductory course or just having informally picked up a language.

Other Interests
================
I keep a blog, the `Mutual Information <http://www.mutualinformation.org>`_, where I discuss things from cooking vegetarian to the relationships between anarco-capitalistic atomic communities and multiculturalism.

When given the opportunity, I will run away for a jog in the park.

I have also worked on some open-source software.
