Software
========

I have written some open-source software, some to scratch an itch, and some as part of my research.

Currently Active Projects
-------------------------

`Pymorph <software/pymorph>`_: Python Morphology Toolbox
........................................................

I did not write this, but I have been maintaining it now for a while.

License: BSD.

`gitcms <software/git-cms>`_
............................

This is the system behind this website. It is a `django` based content managed system, where all the content is stored on flat text files. I use git to manage those text files and publish on the website.
