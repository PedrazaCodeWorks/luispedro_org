Software
========

I have written some open-source software, some to scratch an itch, and some as part of my research.

Currently Active Projects
-------------------------

`Pymorph <software/pymorph>`_: Python Morphology Toolbox
........................................................

I did not write this, but I have been maintaining it now for a while.

License: BSD.

`gitcms <software/git-cms>`_
............................

This is the system behind this website. It is a `django` based content managed system, where all the content is stored on flat text files. I use git to manage those text files and publish on the website.

Dormant Projects
----------------

These are projects that work but which I am not too interested in pursuing write now, but which I might revive in the future.

`ncreduce <software/ncreduce>`_: No Copy Reduce Operations for Numpy
....................................................................

This improves on the speed of reduce-type operations in `numpy <http://www.numpy.org>`_. The code works great for its purpose, but it is too large (the binary is huge).

I learned a lot about numpy's internals while doing it and I developed this technique for writing fast clean C++ to work on numpy code.
