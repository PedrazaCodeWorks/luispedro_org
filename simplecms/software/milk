Milk: Machine Learning Toolkit in Python
========================================

This is the code that I use for my research projects.

Where can I get it?
-------------------

`Github <http://github.com/luispedro/milk/>`_ as usual.

Features
--------

- Pythonic interface to libSVM. I took their code and implemented a wrapper instead of using auto-generated ones.
- Stepwise Discriminant Analysis for feature selection.
- K-means clustering. A simple implementation but it works well with very large datasets.

TODO
----

- Little documentation beyond the API docs.
- It requires `scipy.weave` to be fast now. It should not.
