Python Morphology Toolbox
=========================
The open source `Python Morphology Toolbox <http://www.mmorph.com/pymorph/>`_
is a very nice piece of software, written by Roberto A. Lutofu and Rubens C.
Machado. Unfortunately, the code had been allowed to rot and did not work with
the more recent `numpy <http://www.numpy.org>`_ libraries.

Since discovering their code, I have been using it and making changes so that
it runs with modern numpy. The license stays BSD and the code can be downloaded
as a `source tar.gz <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymorph>`_ file from pypi.
Installation follows the typical

   python setup.py install

You can also use `easy_install`:

    easy_install pymorph


Documentation
-------------

Autogenerated `API Docs </pymorph-apidocs/html>`_ are fairly complete even if the formatting is dirty.

Releases
--------

Since there is feature stability, I release on `PyPI
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymorph>`_ whenever I have fixed a new bug (to make
it easy for people who use `easy_install` or `pip` to keep up).

For more minor fixes (documentation reformatting), you can check the continuous
release on `github <http://github.com/luispedro/pymorph/>`_.

Support
-------

`Email me <mailto:lpc@cmu.edu>`_. If you report a bug, I will try to fix it. If
it has a unit test, I **promise** to fix it.

Currently, there are no known bugs, but there are certainly unknown bugs, which
is why I *need* people to report them.

TODO
----
- Write more tests.
- Re-format the documentation. The previous documentation was a bit too verbose
  for my taste and not in any standard format. I am slowly re-writing some of
  it in restructured text.
- Do something about the demos. They don't work. I need to either fix them or
  delete them.

Once these are done, I will release this as 1.0

Changes from Original
---------------------

The most important change has been the *removal of superfluous functions*.
Functions that deal with **image input/output** or **image display** *have been
removed*. The reason is that `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/>`_
is a much better implementation of this. I see no point in going through the
effort of maintaining thin wrappers around its functionality. For plotting, use
matplotlib (it also has a *imread* function based on `PIL
<http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/>`_).

I removed the *mm*  prefix from function names. Function name prefixes are
needed in Matlab, which does not have namespaces, but they're un-Pythonic
(given that Python has namespaces).

I also changed other small things, including removing some functions which were
superfluous. See the CHANGES_SINCE_08 file in the distribution. A module called
pymorph.compat contains old function names as well as all the functions that
were removed. If you have code which depends on the old names, use this.
Otherwise, I recommend you use the new names. I will remove `compat` for version
1.0 as I would like that version to be a clean one.

I have also implemented a couple of missing functions (like *watershed*).
