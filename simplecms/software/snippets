Litte bits of code that are cute or otherwise helpful.


Python Trie
-----------

Here's how to build a word-trie in a few lines of code:

::
    
    # phrases = [ ('how','now','brown','cow'), ('what',...
    
    from collections import defaultdict
    def recursive():
        return defaultdict(recursive)
    SUCCESS = object()
    trie = recursive()
    for p in phrases:
        top = trie
        for w in p:
            top = top[w]
        top[SUCCESS] = p


The above example is a trie over words, but it could be over characters as well. Here's how to use it to parse a big text for matches:

::

    #text = ['a','long','list','of','words',...
    
    # Active will hold the list of locations in the trie that we are currently
    # looking at. At each step, we both start at the root and move down every
    # active node.
    active = []
    for w in text:
        active.append(trie)
        i = 0
        while i < len(active):
            if w in active[i]:
                active[i] = active[i][w]
                if SUCCESS in active[i]:
                    print 'Match', active[i][SUCCESS]
                i += 1
            else:
                del active[i]

This isn't the fastest way to do things, but it's fast enough for what I wanted it for.
