NGH: NGS (Next Generation Sequencing) in Haskell
================================================

Handle NGS data in Haskell using a Conduit based interface.

This is for my own work and the functionality, but you are welcome to use it if
it fits your needs. If you do, let me know and we might be able to work
together.
